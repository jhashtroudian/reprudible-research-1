code to load the dataset from c:/reprocible-research
```{r}
# clean environment
rm(list=ls())
setwd("c:/reprocible-research")
activity_df <- read.csv("activity.csv")

```

load needed packages
Note: This is just in case I may not use all or even any of the following packages

```{r}
# laod libraries for tidying - not all will be used in all this weeks assignment
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(lubridate)
require(ggplot2)

```

First: plot a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
# get rid of NAs in data frame
activity_df_no_na <- na.omit(activity_df)
# group by date
gd_activity_df_no_na <- group_by(activity_df_no_na, date)
stepsums <- summarise(gd_activity_df_no_na, sum(steps)) 
gooddates<-as.Date(stepsums$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
barplot(stepsums$`sum(steps)`, names.arg = gooddates)

```
