## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document:


code to load the dataset from c:/reprocible-research
```{r}
# clean environment
rm(list=ls())
setwd("c:/reprocible-research")
activity_df <- read.csv("activity.csv")

```

load needed packages
Note: This is just in case I may not use all or even any of the following packages

```{r}
# laod libraries for tidying - not all will be used in all this weeks assignment
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(lubridate)
require(ggplot2)

```

First: plot a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day 
For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

```{r}

# group by date
gd_activity_df <- group_by(activity_df, date)
stepsums <- summarise(gd_activity_df, sum(steps))

print(stepsums)

hist(stepsums$`sum(steps)`, main = "Histogram of the Total number of steps taken each day", xlab = "total number of steps taken each day")

```

Mean and median number of steps taken each day in this case we get rid of the NAs

```{r}
mean(na.omit(stepsums$`sum(steps)`))
median(na.omit(stepsums$`sum(steps)`))

```

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
# get rid of NAs in data frame
activity_df_no_na <- na.omit(activity_df)
steps_per_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity_df_no_na, mean)
plot( steps_per_interval$interval,  steps_per_interval$steps, type="l", main = "Average number of steps taken per interval over the days", ylab="Number of steps", xlab ="Interval")

```
